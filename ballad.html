    The story is set in the Capitol and the protagonist of the book is Coriolanus of the great house Snow.The once affluent
    family Snow lost a lot of their wealth during the period commonly referred to as the Dark Days when the 13 Districts of
    Panem rebelled against the Capitol for the very first time.The Capitol,a place that once had people living an
    ostentatious lifestyle is now reduced to dust and rubble.
    </p>
   
   <p> Poverty is rampant in all of Panem and most people cannot even afford food for the day. It was decided that as a
    punishment for the rebellion,the 12 districts each had to send a male and female tribute to participate in the deadly
    Hunger Games.The tributes from different districts are pitched against each other in a fight to the death where the last
    surviving tribute wins the game.Coriolanus Snow decides to mentor a tribute because if that tribute wins,he could be
    granted a scholarship to the University.</p>
    
    <p>In the first half of the book we see Snow bonding with his tribute Lucy Gray Baird from District 12. Initially, Snow had
    lost all hope of Lucy winning as she was a little dainty girl who could only sing, which is not a quality that would be
    useful in the game of death and life in the arena. But as the book progresses we see Snow discovering her abilities and
    them working as a cohesive unit. As the day of the game nears, Snow truly wants Lucy to win and goes to the length of
    breaking the game rules, in order to help her win.</p>
    
    <p>While mentoring, Coriolanus befriends Sejanus Plinth, a former resident of District 2 who has a rebellious spirit much
    at odds with that of Snow. Sejanus is against the cruel and deadly rules of the Hunger Games. It is strange to see two
    very different characters with completely different ideologies as friends. Sejanus considered Snow to be his true
    friend, but for Snow he was a means to please Sejanus’s parents who were still rich and affluent. Throughout the
    story,many aspects of Snow’s personality are highlighted and we witness his transformation from a conflicted teenager to
    the self assured Snow that we all know from the Hunger Games trilogy. There are instances in the book where we see his
    human side, where he is sympathetic to the conditions of the tributes, and the state they are kept in. But this is the
    only part of the Hunger Games he doesn’t agree with. In his mind the games should continue to maintain control over the
    districts but only with much better treatment to the tributes before the games.</p>
    
    <p>Violence for his loved ones is wrong, but according to him it is required to control others and maintain the structure
    of the society. He goes against the rules of the Capitol to win the game, but opposes his friend when he tries to save
    an innocent girl from the tortures of the Capitol prison. As the plot progresses this conflicted nature eventually made
    me dislike his character, where he started to make decisions that suited him.My favorite character in the book is
    Sejanus. I like that he is brave to voice his opinions against the inhumane nature of the Hunger Games.He is unlike any
    other mentor who does not want to win the games, but wants to start amending the twisted system of the Capitol. The game
    was a little too slow paced and stretched out.There are some plots in the story that were unexpected and very
    intriguing.The story also portrays a very loving relationship between Snow and his cousin and his grandma.</p>

    <p> "Coriolanus felt ill but incapable of looking away. It would have been horrifying to see any creature displayed this way
    — a dog, a monkey, a rat, even — but a boy? And a boy whose only real crime had been to run for his life? .” <footer>-Suzanne Collin</footer> <cite>The Ballad of SongBirds and Snakes</cite></p>

    <p> 
    There are many moments like this where you realize Snow is also a human, who cares for the people he loves and wants to
    do what is right. But this also highlighted his twisted sense of right and wrong.</p>
 
   <p> I started the Hunger Games series with this prequel and had high expectations, but the book did not live up to them. The
    book missed to excite me and keep me hooked. I would therefore give this book a 2.5 star rating.
