        One of the best books to learn about building and habits and ensuring that they stick around. I have been through
        several self help books in an attempt to build up my life. This is one of the best one to work with.
    </p>
    <p>
        This is a book that needs people to work with, not a one time read get a jist and try to apply to your life. There are
        points which need to be reread, understood and applied. And the order just doesn’t matter, just get to the books and
        start applying those principles.This book talks about all the factors that influence our habits, our social group, our
        environment and the things we surround ourselves with. It emphasizes how small modifications and alterations can help
        you change your bad habits into good ones.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you do not take anything else from the book, just take home this point. The difference between successful people and
        not so successful people is not their goals, but the system they use to achieve these goals. The habits around which
        they have built their life. Everyone wants to be rich and successful. But not everybody is rich and successful.
    </p>
    <p>
        In order to build a successful habit that sticks around, a person should change his identity not his goals. If your
        identity conflicts with your goals, well then you are doomed. This book also builds upon several factors which makes
        sticking to our habits a tad bit easier.
    </p>
    <p>
        Habit is a routine. Each habit has cue, a craving, a procedure and a reward. The key lies in cue. Without the same,
        habit just won’t begin. And reward is the reason why habit is built. Better the reward more are the chances that a habit
        sticks around. And today, every multi billion company has tapped into the same. Notifications are the cue. Once you hear
        that pop sound of a new email or a message, you are tempted to read. Reading the message is the procedure and the
        satisfaction you get on reading the same is your reward. Even if the email were not important, we have wasted our
        precious seconds, which adds up to hours at the end of the day. Instagram likes also work on the same principle.
    </p>
    <p>
        To build habits that last long all you need to do is, have a well defined cue and satisfying reward. Not only that, but
        if the habit you are trying to build is easier to perform, chances are that you will end with an excellent habit.
    </p>
    <p>
        Maintaining a habit chart and rewarding yourself once you hit your benchmark is also a motivational factor.After some
        time the routine becomes boring and we may be tempted to jump to another task. In that case the need to maintain the
        streak takes over. The initial resistance is tough to overcome, if you miss more than two days at a time, before you
        know, you have already broken the chain and forgotten about the habit you were trying to inculcate. A successful habit
        is the one where you fall in love with the routine.
    </p>
    <p>
        Another way to inculcate good habits is to introduce a routine that you already complete. This is known as a habit
        stacking. Journaling is a great way to keep track of our activities and also share our thoughts.I wanted to journal but
        always found excuses not to do the same. Either I was tired or had another commitment to complete. I decided to journal
        after having my morning tea. In this way, I would always journal as soon as I had my tea. As it had become a part of my
        already existing routine it was much easier to inculcate then building a new habit stack from scratch.
    </p>
    <p>
        Like to build a habit you make the cue visible to get rid of a bad one, you make it invisible.You also make the outcome
        of the habit undesirable and the process tedious and introduce lots of friction. I was addicted to social media Every
        day I would waste hours scrolling through instagram, as soon as I woke up. I decided to remove the app from my phone to
        remove the cue. I decided to introduce friction to make the process tedious, so now every time I had the urge to scroll
        through my feed I had to login through a web browser. After some time this long procedure started to seem tiresome and
        it automatically decreased the number of hours I spent on instagram.
    </p>

    <p>
        This book has 1 sentence summary to which a person can refer when they want to. It makes it easy to read and go back to.
        I would recommend that people not just read this book but apply the techniques provided to build habits. And also do not
        inculcate all of them together but few at a time, so instead of being overwhelmed by the magnitude of change in habits
        you can make some slow and productive progress.
    </p>

    <p>
        During these difficult times of the pandemic, trapped inside our homes with nothing much to do it is easy to fall for
        bad habits, but reading this book might just give you the motivation and push to change them.
