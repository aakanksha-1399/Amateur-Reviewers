            We all know that we should never judge a book by its cover but that’s exactly what I did with this one and I must say I
            shouldn’t have.</p>
            
            <p>House of Dragons promises a Game of Thrones kind of fantasy replete with dragons,a fight for the throne,magic and a lot
            of violence.</p>
            
            <p>Set in the kingdom of Etrusia,the Emperor is dead and it’s time for the new monarch to be chosen.The choice is to be
            made among five individuals,each representing a House of Etrusia, who have to succeed in the Trial to be crowned as the
            ruler.The heads of the five houses have all been training and preparing their first born for the Trial because the elder
            child is always chosen to compete.But in a twist of fate that no one had foreseen,the younger children are chosen much
            to the chagrin of the heads who think they have all lost a chance to rule.Only one can win so the five chosen ones
            should give their best to succeed or pay the price of failure.</p>
            
            <p>For Emilia,books have been her only companions and her knowledge is her biggest weapon.Lucian is an exceptional soldier
            who is haunted by his past and has sworn to never lift a sword again.Vespir might just be the best dragon trainer in all
            of Etrusia but she’s a servant and has been looked down upon all her life.Ajax has a thirst to prove himself and will
            take whatever he wants.Hyperia has been receiving the best training that Volschian gold could buy and will stop at
            nothing to take the throne.</p>
            
            <p>The book has 5 POVs and alternates between them giving us a keen insight into the characters’ minds.</p>
            
            <p>In the first half of the book,the only character I had any real interest in was Hyperia.She and Emilia seemed to be the
            only ones who really wanted the throne,others were just surviving.Lucian had a lot of potential but I failed to like him
            at the start.Ajax provided the necessary comic relief and after Hyperia,his POV was perhaps the most
            interesting.Lucian,Emilia and Vespir shine towards the end of the book and we see that Lucian and Vespir still have some
            fight left in them.Since the start I knew Emilia was stronger than she let on and we see how truly powerful she is at
            the end.</p>
            
            <p>I will read the next book of this series because of the dragons.The author does an excellent job describing them and
            they are undoubtedly the best part of the book.There is a lot of action involving dragons and they have their own
            personalities as well.Some of the dragons (like Dog) were more interesting than the characters if I am being honest.</p>
            
            <p>The story is quite fast paced and despite the 5 POVs it is easy to follow the plot.There is just a hint of a romance and
            it does not overshadow the plot in any way.If you are looking for some amazing storytelling,this is not the right
            book.The language used is very banal and it should have been more descriptive.There are scenes of extreme violence and
            brutality which is unexpected from a young adult fantasy book.</p>
            </p> 
            <p>Overall the book was a disappointment for me and it could not meet my expectations.</p>
            
            <p>I will recommend this book to every reader who loves dragons because she has got that part right.But sadly,that is
            perhaps the only part that she got right for me because I did not like the characters or the writing.</p>
