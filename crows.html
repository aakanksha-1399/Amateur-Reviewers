            <p>6 Characters. 1 impossible feat. 30 million Kruge</p>
            
           <p>The story begins in Ketterdam, the capital city of Kerch where money is the only God and no morality exists.The streets
            of Ketterdam are lined with merchants who fill their coffers with international trade but its dark underbelly is home to
            various criminal organizations or “gangs”. Kaz “Dirtyhands” Brekker is the leader of one such gang called the dregs.He
            is contacted by a merchant Jan Van Eck, to retrieve a prisoner from the Ice Court, for a reward of 30 million Kruge.
            Shrewd,ruthless and artful Kaz has a penchant for violence and he will achieve whatever he desires no matter the cost.To
            carry out this deadly task that will make him rich beyond his wildest dreams,he assembles the following crew:
            
            <p>A convict with a thirst for revenge – Kaz Brekker</p>
            
            <p>A sharpshooter who can’t walk away from a wager – Jesper</p>
            
            <p>A runaway with a privileged past – Wylan</p>
            
            <p>A spy known as the Wraith-Inej Ghafa</p>
            
            <p>A Heartrender using her magic to survive the slums -Nina Zenik</p>
    
            <p>A thief with a gift for unlikely escapes – Matthias Helvar</p>
            
            <p>This group of misfits though very different in personalities are united in their purpose of getting the prisoner
            out,only then will they receive the millions.But the prison to be breached is no ordinary prison.It is a part of the Ice
            court which is a military stronghold and the seat of power of Fjerdan nobility.Secured by Fjerdan soldiers (Druskelle) ,
            it is a fortress whose walls have never been breached successfully.Faced with such a seemingly impossible task,our crew
            must be prepared to face all kinds of obstacles thrown in their way.Will the crew succeed in pulling off this impossible
            mission?Would this quest be worth the price they would be paying?</p>
            
            <p>I often contemplated picking up this book. The hype surrounding the book made me weary to read it. So much so that I
            have kept this book on my to be read for a long time.</p>
            
            <p>The only thing I did not like about this book is its initial slow pace.The first few chapters of the book focus a lot on
            setting and buildup,but once you are past them,the book is a complete delight.</p>
            
            <p>There are many things that I loved about this book.The writing is beautiful and detailed,just enough to draw you in and
            get hooked to the book.But Leigh Bardugo shows her exceptional skills as an author with the characters.They all have
            very impressive skills,honed over the years by the need to survive.All the characters are flawed and on the morally grey
            side but with their intricately woven pasts,Bardugo does a great job of making us root for them.And I do root for
            them,till the very end.</p>
            
            <p>What I loved about this book is that the characters are flawed, each of them has a weakness, something which makes them
            vulnerable, something which makes them human. A thirst for revenge,feeling lost, an urge to gamble, a need to prove your
            worth. Each flaw with which we can easily relate.The goofy and lighthearted beginning is like the calm before a storm
            and it soon paves the way to something dark and insidious.Romance doesn’t overshadow the plot. The plot is written in
            such a way that we feel like we are present with them. Climbing the incinerator, fighting for life, making schemes to
            leave with our lives and money. The fights were nail biting, the escapes made us hold our breath. Writing is a treat to
            our imagination. Most YA books have a love interest from the middle of the novel if not from the beginning. And it kinda
            starts grating me. But this book did not. It was the job which was the most important. The focus did not shift from the
            main plot to delve into another subplot. Lately I have been digging the same.</p>
            
            <p>The multiple point of views also allows us to keep track of what is happening, in a way giving a wholesome view of
            everything that is happening. The book has multiple things happening simultaneously such that it always keeps us on our
            toes. I love being in the loop. It makes me feel like I am a part of something which is bigger, grander in the scheme of
            things. The stakes are high. If the quest goes wrong then our beloved crows would either wind up being dead or would be
            in prison neither of them is of good consequence.No redos. No once again. Everything has to be done at a single strike.
            Leigh Bardugo has kept us in the loop but barely. We have a vague idea as to what they are going to do. But even in our
            lives,everything always doesn’t work out.We improvise our plans according to the circumstances and so do our crows.</p>
            
            <p>Each character has a backstory, which partially explains what they are.I despise backstory in a novel. Mostly because
            the author doesn’t know how to write one properly. They either drown us with information or the character is having a
            monologue. But the backstory in this one, man they were great. I loved every tid bit of it. The plot of the story is
            simple. I did not love the book because of its plot. I loved it for the characters. Lesson 101 of writing books-
            Character development. And I say Leigh Bardugo has got it right. When you start rooting for all the character *except
            Mathias, Don’t shoot me. I just could not do it* you know the work is excellent. I am going to probably keep singing
            praises of Nina Zenik for the rest of the days, but she slightly reminds me of Gina Linetti from Brooklyn 99. No clue
            why? Just she does and both are my favorite. I would give this book 4.5 stars. Lost 0.5 for the slow beginning which
            made me put down the book multiple times. I regret reading the book so late. The book has everything one desires in
            young adult fiction:A heist,lots of action with a slight touch of magic and characters which are complicated but we
            can’t help but fall in love with them</p>
