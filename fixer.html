        <p> When I contemplate rereading a book,it should be a big clue about how awesome it is. I started reading the book with no
        expectation.I normally don’t do so but the summary often piques my interest and I mentally start picturing how good the
        book can be. I started reading this book with no mental picture or opinion in my mind and boy I am glad that I did.</p>
        
        <p>Set in a fast paced world of lies, deceit and power this book makes one of the first YA novels with no romantic love
        interest. Just a girl who is unwillingly sucked into this game of power and refuses to be the pawn. Honestly, I cannot
        say much about this book without giving away its plot twist. There are too many to count. Some which can be predicted,
        most which cannot. And some which you cannot even think about. I fell in love with this book. The writing was simple and
        elegant. Though the book is about the political power, and is big on who knows who. Someone who is not interested in
        politics is also invested in this book. The fact that I want to learn more about US politics after reading this book
        should be a big indication as to how invested I became while reading this book.</p>
        
        <p>I have been in a reading slump and have not been able to pick a good book to read in ages. Mostly because they
        disappoint me. And sometimes because I can predict the ending and this prevents me from enjoying the book. But this one
        brought me out of my slump and I have actively scoured the internet for any tidbit of information as to what will happen
        next.</p>
        
        <p>The key highlight of a good book for me is well fleshed characters with intriguing pasts all contributing to the plot in
        some useful way.This book has it all with adults who have checkered pasts and play a significant role in the plot and
        are not mere accessories whose only job is driving their kids to school.</p>
        
        <p> I would give this book a 5 star. For its unpredictable plot twist. For its lovable characters and a no bullshit main
        character like Tess.For the fact that it got me out of a reading slump and for teaching me a valuable lesson:“TRUST NO
        ONE”.</p>
